I bought a bunch of containers recently. My room and my car had been in chaos for a while, I had not seen the bottom of my car's trunk since I took it to Burning Man *last year*. I still had my tent, camping gear, old bags of coffee, books, trash, and a confederacy of paper (mail, notes, bills). On top of all of it, I had, in my backseat, two big containers I had picked up at CVS for the purpose of organizing the mess -- now ironically contributing to the pile.

I took a few days off work. I don't know why, but I felt guilty about doing things like cleaning my car or room on the weekends, because I felt I should be out seeing friends that I don't typically get to see any more because of how much work eats in to my week. So, those containers sat there until I had a PTO friday to disassemble the sedimentation in my car -- guilt free. 

It took me about 5 hours, all told, to remove everything, vacuum the carpets, organize the mess now surrounding my car, get the random clothes in to a washer (still going), box up the things I still have use for to take home, and file away my camping gear in to storage. But now it's clean -- I now have a car that more than a single person can ride in (the boxes and camping gear and rest of the mess had been the permanent passengers). 

It's small, but I feel an enormous amount of relief having finished it. I bought a few more boxes to start tackling my closet. 

There's no moral or message to this post. I think this is just a nice way to break the ice with my blog.
